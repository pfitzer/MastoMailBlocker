class VerifyFailedException(Exception):
    """

    VerifyFailedException is a custom Exception class that is raised when a verification process fails.

    This class is intended to be used in situations where a specific verification condition is not met or an assertion fails.

    Usage:
        To raise a VerifyFailedException, simply raise an instance of the class. For example:

        >>> raise VerifyFailedException("Verification failed!")

    Attributes:
        This class inherits from the built-in Exception class and does not introduce any new attributes.

    Methods:
        Since this class is a subclass of Exception, it inherits all of the methods from the Exception class.

    Exception Handling:
        When catching a VerifyFailedException, it is suggested to catch Exception instead of VerifyFailedException specifically.
        This will allow catching any other exceptions that might be thrown in the same try-except block.

        Example:

        >>> try:
        >>>     # Perform verification process
        >>>     if verification_fails:
        >>>         raise VerifyFailedException("Verification failed!")
        >>> except Exception as e:
        >>>     print("An error occurred:", str(e))

    """
    pass
